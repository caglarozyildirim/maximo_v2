## Management Summary

Maintenance department manages its whole operation on the application of Maximo. IT department has multiple application technology to serve multiple goals. There is an ongoing effort to collect most of the running application to a common technology to decrease licensing cost and improve support capabilities.

Exchange date can be in future or in the past. if left empty it will be filled with current date when approval process finished.
If one of the users rejects the process ends with rejection and asset assignment records won’t change but the request records will be kept
If a manager approves a record on behalf of his/her employee a pki card approval should be taken by personnel or signed document image should be uploaded at the approval session.
Auto asset assignment will be created for the each asset hold on the user that is being off-boarding. Receiving user will be its first manager but it can be change by the manager.
Only approved maintenance personal could change asset status during this process
Even though ticket is rejected users still can add documents and add comments
First manager of current holder can act on be half of current holder, if it’s the case second high managers should approve the assignment so that one higher manager approve.
If an assignment starts with of boarding it should be stated at description as “Users off boarding process has been started.”
We should be able to download a PDF document that have the information of the process, legal information’s and approval information. It can be downloaded at any time but if an approval missing it should be clearly visible(highlighted with red color).
The process can be started on behalf of current user but assets can not receive on be half of a user. Always user should approve the legal warnings before the ticket finalized.
If a user hesitates from approving asset receiving record will be wait for 30 days and automatically passed to approver manager. Approver manager should be informed before about this process and possible asset receiving before approval.
Current assignee field will be filled automatically to easily identify the person that action is waited from. When process finished it will be emptied.
There is an parallel approval process on the flow but current assignee can be decided as the following order; current holders first manager than, new holder manager approval than, current holder.
There is 2 different identification for user. The first one is company employee Id. Every person has this number. Second one is Windows domain user Id. Every person that has computer access has this number and login process will be handled with this user information. Maintenance management application might have new unique id for each user but it shouldn’t shown to the user unless there is a technical problem. Users can see the Company employee ID’s last three digit of other users.
